    Living the life with both eyes closed,
    <br />
    Them souls are vessels for the curse &#8212;
    <br />
    The soil that lives off poisoned source.
    <br />
    <br />
    Lost in the awe of preacher&#39;s voice,
    <br />
    Delirious, bereft of force,
    <br />
    They succumb to the salient noise,
    <br />
    The one they never get disposed.
    <br />
  </VerseStyled>
